# Spawn Everything

# THIS WAS AND IS A TEST MOD.

Please do not ever use this as a reference. Leave now. Please do not examine this cursed code. I used https://github.com/forthfora/slugcat-stats-config as a reference, so go look at that instead.

The only purpose of this mod was to practice the most basic IL hook ever.

All it does is disable a check for whether a creature should spawn in a specific campaign, overriding the boolean to true.
